# "Les 3 Petits Cochons" display website

This is the display website made for the restsaurant "Les 3 Petits Cochons" in Laval (France).

This is my 2nd project on my way to become web developer.

I have done everything from scratch including photos, design and texts.

I used HTML, CSS, SASS technolgies and I used Visual Studio Code to code it.
